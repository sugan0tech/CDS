1.First node must be a head node. We should not use original 
  name for traversing.
2.Last node must have NULL pointer
3.For connecting any two nodes:
           temp1->next = temp2;
4.For traversing from one node to another node:
           temp2 = temp1->next;
5.Duplicate the head node / any node :
               temp  = head;
